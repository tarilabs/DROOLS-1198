Ref DROOLS-1198

https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DROOLS-1198

Use Drools version 6.4.0.Final to demonstrate the issue, use instead ..

.. Drools version 6.5.0.CR2 or above to demonstrate the fix properly addresses the issue.

NOTICE: this reproducer for DROOLS-1198 make sense only when running on a real Mac OSX (case preserving/insensitive filesystem.)
If instead a platform-indipendent reproducer/JUnit test is needed to demonstrate the Mac OSX issue on ANY platform, reference the commit of the DROOLS-1198 fix, it contains a reproducer/JUnit test demonstrating the Mac OSX issue regardless of the actual running platform, and can be used to demonstrate the Mac OSX issue indeed on ANY platform.
